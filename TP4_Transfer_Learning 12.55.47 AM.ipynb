Usually, we evaluate models according to the performance, which means only after testing procedure we are more aware of trained models. Then, the difficulty relates to complex dynamic environment because during the training procedure, the coefficients and parameters are updated along with time. Even there is corresponding criteria for evaluation, probably, the value of parameters could outperform in next few iterations or steps. At the meantime, it definitely takes up more space or capability, which would lead to longer training time and poorer output.

        "First method we implemented is using 3 convolutional layers, 1 maxpooling layer and 2 fully connected layers. As the result showed, the accuracy on training data could reach 73% with 100 epochs while it is 24% on test dataset. \\\n",

        "\\\n",
        "As for transfer learning, we chose the architecture of ResNet50 and the trained parameters, froze all layers except the last fully connected layer, and changed the last layer into our self-defined structure and put in data training. Again, the epoch 10 exercise didn't work out well, so we adjusted it again to 100. Even this time, the accuracy on the training set did not improve, and the performance was far from ideal. \n",
        "\n",
        "From our perspectives,\n",
        "* primitive CNN has the advantages that it took less time, the accuracy on training set can reach a less bad level. However, since we only trained with 100 images instead of large datasets, the result still has space to be improved. We assume it is because back propagation requires big amount of training data.\n",
        "* ResNet-18 is to address the gradient vanishing problem and it has less complexity. Because it is relatively small and efficient compared to deeper networks such as ResNet-50 or ResNet-101, it is easier to train and deploy on resource-constrained devices.  But, the architecture is not always adaptive to all kinds of tasks. And it tends to perform better when it is given numerous data, which probably can explain why it didn't achieve a good-looking state from our trials. Even though ResNet-18 uses skip connections, which allows gradients to flow back more easily during training, resulting in better convergence and faster training times, it didn't present more efficiency according to our results (from graph).\n",
        "* For transfer learning method, obviously, the advantage is having DNN model without inputting huge amount of training data. By standing on the shoulders of giants, we can adjust the well-trained model with much less data. But as it showed in our results, it actually happened that implementing transfer learning can lead to a poor performance. There are several potential reasons, such as source task is not highly relevant to target task, or transfering method is not sufficiently appropriate. It is also important to quantify the amount of transfer that affects the quality and feasibility of transfer in transfer learning. This is one of challenges of implementing the technique."

For second one, it shows the trend that as more epochs are put in, the higher accuracy the models are likely to have. But the red one, base model, actually has a decline at the end. What is the interesting finding is that when it comes to the accuracy on test dataset, the red one shows an increase along with epochs. And the rest three model are providing the almost same output for test dataset."
